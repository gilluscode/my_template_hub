                <h1>THE DAY THE DEVIL WENT TO CONFESSION WITH PADRE PIO!</h1>
                <hr>
                <br>
                  <p>There are some magnificent stories about St. Pio or as he is affectionately known Padre Pio. 
                    I wanted to share a story narrated by a spiritual child of Padre Pio. The story can be found on Youtube but is narrated in Italian. I will leave a link in the research box. 
                    This story leads us to when the devil himself went confessing to Padre Pio. Yes apparently, the story is true!</p>
                    <br>
                 <p>Lets dive into this story!</p>

                        <h1>Padre Pio of Petrelcina</h1>
                        <hr>
                          <br>
                            <p>I will not dive into the full Biography of Padre Pio as I will leave that to later stories. I believe short stories are easier to digest and that the reader can easily reflect and decide what to take in from the content. St. Pio had encountered many battles with the Devil, that was proven. He received attacks from demons and Satan himself. Demons kicked him and spat on him at times and most of the attacks happened during the night. A demon once told him that he creates more trouble than Saint Michael but that’s a story for another day.</p>
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <p>Padre pio was a mystic. This means that he had reached a high level of purity and even science today confirms that such people become equipped with special inttelect that allows them to have what we refer to supernatural abilities such reading minds and have healing the sick. However, Padre Pio and other mystics were not spared from attacks from evil spirits.</p>

                      <h1>So what happened?</h1>
                      <hr>
                      <br>
                        <p>One day Padre Pio was in confession when a tall and slim man approached for confession. He wore an elegant suit and spoke with polite manners. 
                          Padre Pio started hearing his sins, but the nature of the sins confessed were rather extreme which were varied in nature with sins against God himself, against mankind, our neighbour and against good morals and virtues.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          After Padre Pio’s repression with the Church’s teaching and the morals of our saints, the confessor rebutted back word for word with in an incredible astute justification of all the sins in their nature making them seem very normal and comprehensible in human nature. 
                          Padre Pio said to himself who must be this person? And tried to look staringly at his face for possible visible gestures. Padre Pio still concentrated on every word he was saying to obtain a clue of the identity of this person.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Then in an immediate quick gesture, Padre Pio said say viva Gesu’ and viva Maria! And imbooh! This devil disappeared leaving an unsupportable smell. We have to say that Padre Pio had been enriched with immense mystic virtues and that the devil himself was curious how pure he was.
                          Quote from Padre Marciano who narrated this story (translated from Italian). The devil is a fallen angel with immense intelligence superior than mankind even though with a perverse nature.
